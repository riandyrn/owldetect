# OwlDetect

Welcome to Haraj take home challenge!

In this challenge you will be assigned to help fictional startup called `OwlDetect` to create their first product. 

`OwlDetect` is a startup that want to fight plagiarism in education sector. They want to create a web app that can be used by highschool teachers to check plagiarism in their students homework.

Plagiarism in highschool is mostly not complicated, usually they fall into one of following category:

1. Students copy the exact phrases from other students homework
2. Students copy then alter some words in the copied phrases
3. Students copy only some phrases while also adding their own phrases

In this repo you will find prototype for `OwlDetect` web app. However currently it is not yet working as they expected because it could only check for the exact match text.

You could see the live version for this app [here](https://dry-woodland-18779.herokuapp.com/).
